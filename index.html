                <p>Challenges add spice to life - the challenge itself and solving it. Perhaps that partially explains why I like what I like: toiling through a tricky math problem and weaving an elegant proof from seemingly unrelated ideas. Or looking for a dim star cluster despite terrible light pollution in NYC but finally catching the photons that have been traveling for thousands of years at the speed of light. Or working on a software project where the complexity of a real world problem has to get broken down into manageable components constrained by a framework or programming language. How thrilling!!</p>
                <p>One of the challenges I've enjoyed has been becoming a software developer via my own path. I chose not to pursue a CS degree, and that has made the learning experience trickier and more introspective than I could have ever imagined. With so many resources available to learn new programming languages, paradigms, frameworks, data structures, algorithms, and so much more, I had to stop myself several times to evaluate what was worth serious study and what topics could be skimmed over. I did realize that learning to become a software developer is like learning to play instrument. You can only learn so much from reading and watching. You have to play. Well, why not check out some of my projects below!</p>

                        <p>Shopify provides the infrastructure to start building a new app via the very convenient Shopify CLI. However, there are only a few choices for server stacks (e.g. Node, Ruby, …). But what if you want to use Spring Boot? One of the challenges is implementing Shopify's OAuth manually. Check out my solution!</p>

                        <p>A non-profit theater needed a multi-language information kiosk to show upcoming events that could be filtered by date, season, event type, and event language. We built a modern React app that uses Strapi as the headless CMS to manage the content and event information.</p>

                        <p>Finding a spot to look up at the stars is no easy task if you live in the city. Tall buildings, street lights, and ordinances restricting access to  public spaces after dark make it tricky. And if you want to drive out of the city, where to? Restricted access and a partial view are still a problem. With this app, stargazers can share spots they’ve found with others. Take a look at the application's microservice architecture powered by Spring Cloud.</p>
